# Anti-Bully-Bot
Cyberbullying is an extremely prevalent issue in the modern digital world. Yet many social media platforms such as Twitter don’t have intelligent cyberbullying detection systems so they don’t effectively address this issue. Because of this, we wanted to create a classifier using artificial intelligence to determine whether a tweet is cyberbullying or not.

This project for EV Hacks 2 is a Twitter bot that uses a machine learning classifier to detect cyberbullying and automatically reply to the tweet to warn the user not to bully. We chose Twitter for this project because it was simple to search through tweets and reply with a bot, but in the future, we could expand this project for other social media platforms.
